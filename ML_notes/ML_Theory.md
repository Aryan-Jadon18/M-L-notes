1: Firstly we know there are 3 kinds of Machine Learning:
  - Supervised Learning (Give it all the data, with labels)
  - Unsupervised Learning (Give the model unlabeled data, and let it find out patterns itself, later test it on futher unlabeled data)
  - Reinforcement Learning (Gamify the learning process, by allocating reward and punishment rules for the model)
