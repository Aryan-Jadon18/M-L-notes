#M-L Theory Revision

1: Firstly we know there are 3 kinds of Machine Learning:
  - Supervised Learning (Give it all the data, with labels)
  - Unsupervised Learning (Give the model unlabeled data, and let it find out patterns itself, later test it on futher unlabeled data)
  - Reinforcement Learning (Gamify the learning process, by allocating reward and punishment rules for the model)

This is an era of mostly usupervised and reinforcement learning. Meanwhile ```Deep Learning``` can be both unsupervised or reinforcement learning.

ðŸ‘¦: For example:
```Autoencoders``` are a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that use deep neural networks to learn a compressed representation of the input data.

There are other learning methods too, like ensemble learning and multi-modal learning methods like bagging etc.. but they'll be included later in this repo.
