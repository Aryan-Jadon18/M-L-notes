**Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images1. They are composed of one or more convolution layers followed by pooling layers, with fully connected layers used at the end for output2.

Here’s a simple breakdown of the components:

1:**Convolutional layers**: These layers apply a series of filters to the input data. Each filter is used to recognize a specific pattern from the data2.

2:**Pooling layers**: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions (i.e., width and height) while retaining the depth. This helps to decrease the computational complexity and control overfitting2.

3:**Fully connected layers**: These layers perform high-level reasoning and yield the final output. They take the features learned by previous layers and use them to classify the input into various categories2.
