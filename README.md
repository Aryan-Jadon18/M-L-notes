# Machine Learning Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning beginner, I started creating this as a hobby or a daily journal for ML enthusiasts.

üììNote: Though this repo is made so, that you can read it, and run code in ```google colab```, you can still install it locally to run code!

‚û°Ô∏èFor efficiency while creating this repo, I've preferred to add basic resources firstly. Those can be improved later on..

##Links to Mind Maps
Here are some mind maps that summarize the concepts of machine learning from data analysis to deep learning:
- [Machine Learning Mindmap](https://github.com/dformoso/machine-learning-mindmap)
- [Deep Learning Mindmap](https://github.com/dformoso/deeplearning-mindmap)

## Handbooks
Here are some diagrams that explain the basics of machine learning for starters:
- [Machine Learning Fundamentals Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/machine-learning-handbook/)
- [Flowchart for Basic Machine Learning Models](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flowchart-for-basic-machine-learning-models/)

## Contribution Guidelines
