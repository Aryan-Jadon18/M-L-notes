# Machine Learning Notes Repository

## 📖 Introduction
This repository is a curated, beginner-friendly journal of machine learning concepts, code snippets, and resources.  
It started as a hobby project and daily journal for ML enthusiasts, and has grown into a structured learning space.

Machine learning is a constantly evolving field, and with discussions around AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) becoming more frequent, a **New Developments** section has been added to keep track of emerging ideas and frameworks.

> 💡 Note: You can run the notebooks directly in **Google Colab** for convenience, or install them locally to experiment on your own system.

➡️ For efficiency, the repository begins with **basic resources**. These will be improved and expanded over time.
