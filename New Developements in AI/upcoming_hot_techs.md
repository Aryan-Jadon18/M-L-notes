1: Vision Transformers (ViT): Transformers, originally designed for natural language processing, have been successfully applied to computer vision tasks. They have shown promising results in image classification tasks, outperforming traditional convolutional neural networks12.

2: Generative Adversarial Networks with Transformers (TransGAN): TransGAN incorporates transformers to ensure consistency in the generation of pixels. It has achieved state-of-the-art results in how closely generated images resemble the training data2.

3: TimeSformer: Facebook’s TimeSformer uses transformers to recognize actions in video clips. It interprets the sequence of video frames, similar to how transformers interpret a sequence of words in text2.

4: Multimodal Transformers: Researchers are training transformers on text and then fine-tuning them for a wide variety of domains including mathematics, logic problems, and computer vision2.

5: Transformers in Bioinformatics: DeepMind’s AlphaFold 2 uses transformers to predict the 3D shapes of proteins based on their sequence of amino acids. This has significant implications for drug discovery and biological research2.
